# Hello I am aidan
***Hello I am Aidan***, and I like developing in Python.

I like OpenCore, I think that it is cool having macOS on your non-apple PC [here is the OC guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)

I also like gaming, who doesn't? [you can subscribe to my channel if you want to see me gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@AidanLikesTech)

I will create some shitty, or in some cases useful, python programs.


# Why do I like tech?
all started when i was 6 years old and I got my first laptop with windows 7 basic, I don't remeber what brand it was but I am sure it wasn't a major one (HP, Acer, Asus etc..). I loved playing with purple place, and I discovered what was the internet. One day, unfortunately, it got stuck in an infinite update: RIP unknown laptop 


# Why do i make scripts/programs in Python?
I just think it is very easy (it is very easy actually)
